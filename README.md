SQL Auto Import is a command-line tool, written in [Python](https://www.python.org/)Â®, that allows you to quickly create/populate or replace tables in a SQL database with multiple CSV files.

PostreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server/T-SQL), and Oracle dialects are supported.

This tool will attempt to load connection settings from a config.json file by default. You can specify
a file to use as a command-line argument. If no file is found or if there is an issue, you will be asked
to input the information below. You will have the options to save the connection settings. 

Additionally, you will need to specify a directory path to your CSV files (e.g. `C:\MyFiles`). You can
also pass this in as a second command-line argument. 

If you do not enter a path, the local directory will be used.

This tool will use the names of your files as table names (*in lowercase*), so make sure they're correct. If a table already exists, it will be replaced.

Only the default schema is currently supported, but support for specifying the schema is on the roadmap (below).

# Usage
The source Python file (`sqlautoimport.py`) is provided, which can be used on any system (Windows, MacOS, Linux) where Python is installed. Dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/kevinlakhani/sqlautoimport/blob/master/requirements.txt) will need to be installed.

For Windows users who do not wish to use or install Python, a [64-bit executable file (.exe)](https://github.com/kevinlakhani/sqlautoimport/raw/master/sqlautoimport.exe) is also provided.

Using the `.exe` file requires Microsoft Visual C++ to be installed on your system.

The when running the .py or .exe file, two command-line arguments may be passed:
 1. The file path of the config file containing connection details
 2. The folder path of the CSV files to be imported to your database

For example, any of the following inputs are valid ways to run this program from the command line:

`sqlautoimport.exe config.json "C:\Path\To\My CSV Files"`

`sqlautoimport.exe custom_connection.json C:\users\me\files`

If these arguments are not passed or if there is an issue with them, you will be prompted to enter those details.

Therefore, it is also valid to simply double click on the `.exe` or `.py` and follow the prompts or to run either file from the command line without extra arguments, e.g.

`sqlautoimport.exe`

or

`sqlautoimport.py`

A blank [config.json] file is also provided to if you'd like to build your own config file without following the command line prompts. It looks like this:
```
{
	"dialect":"",
	"host":"",
	"database":"",
	"port":"",
	"username":"",
	"password":""
}
```
# Roadmap
 - [ ] macOS and Linux packages/bundled executables
 - [ ] Support for Redshift, Presto and [other "external" dialects](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/dialects/#external-dialects)
 - [ ] Support for schema specification
 - [ ] Support for `.json` files
 - [ ] Support for different delimiters and file extensions (e.g. `.tsv`)
 - [ ] Support for specifying modes other than `replace` (e.g. `append`)
 - [ ] Web GUI
 - [ ] Override default column type settings (e.g. specify a column as `money` instead of `double` or `smallint` instead of `bigint`)
 - [ ] Performance tuning: specify chunk size and/or auto-select settings based on data size
